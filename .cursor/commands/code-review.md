Review the uncomitted changes:

- Do we have any dead code? delete it.
- Did we add quality tests? Prefer, fewer, higher quality tests.
- Are there any glaring perf holes we can improve on without severly sacrificing readability?
- Can we use more modern abstractions for improved safety and readability?
